          At stei, we are dedicated to providing high-quality online interactive workshops and programs that cater to
          the diverse learning needs of our users. Our workshops are designed to empower individuals with knowledge,
          skills, and growth opportunities. We understand that circumstances may arise where you need to cancel a
          purchase or request a refund. This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines the terms and conditions under
          which cancellations and refunds are granted. By purchasing and using our services, you agree to the terms
          stated below.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to provide a flexible and user-friendly experience. If you wish to cancel a purchase, please review the
          following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>
            You may request a cancellation within 24 hours of making the payment, provided that you have not accessed
            the content of the workshop. If the workshop has been accessed in any form, cancellation will not be
            permitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a workshop has been partially or fully accessed, cancellation is not allowed due to the nature of
            digital content delivery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancellation requests must be submitted by contacting our customer support team at support@stei.pro with
            your purchase details, including order number and email ID used for registration.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the cancellation request meets the eligibility criteria, our team will confirm the cancellation and
            initiate the refund process, if applicable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We want to ensure customer satisfaction while maintaining fairness in our policies. Refund requests are
          processed as per the following guidelines:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>
            Refunds are only applicable if a cancellation request is made within the 24-hour cancellation window and the
            user has not accessed any part of the workshop content.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a workshop has been accessed, no refund will be provided, as digital content is considered consumed upon
            access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refunds will be processed within 7-10 business days from the date of approval and will be credited back to
            the original payment method used during the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refunds will not be granted for workshops purchased during promotional offers, discounts, or bundled
            packages unless a technical issue prevents access.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a technical issue prevents you from accessing the workshop and our support team is unable to resolve it
            within a reasonable timeframe, a full refund may be granted upon verification of the issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refunds will not be issued due to change of mind, incorrect selection of a workshop, or inability to
            complete the workshop.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Exceptions and Special Cases</h2>
        <p>In certain exceptional cases, refunds or credits may be provided at our discretion:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>
            If duplicate payments are made due to a technical error, the excess amount will be refunded after
            verification.
          </li>
          <li>
            If stei cancels a workshop or discontinues access to a specific program, users will receive a full refund or
            an equivalent credit towards another workshop.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a workshop is significantly different from its description or fails to deliver promised content, users
            may raise a refund request for review.
          </li>
        </ul>
