              The Strength of She is a transformative workshop designed specifically for women in professional
              environments who often find themselves carrying multiple responsibilities yet feeling unseen or
              undervalued.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Through guided exercises, reflective practices, and collaborative discussions, participants will uncover
              their innate strengths, address limiting beliefs, and develop practical strategies to navigate workplace
              challenges with confidence and authenticity.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              This workshop creates a safe, supportive space for women to connect, share experiences, and build a
              network of like-minded professionals who understand their unique journey.
